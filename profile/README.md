# Welcome to Fylgja

Fylgja is a component based CSS framework.

Focusing on making it easier to use CSS components with any other styles.

The main focus for Fylgja is to offer each CSS components as a sepprate package,
allowing you to use only what you need!

It is ready for the future,
but also works in every moderen browser,
and is RTL friendly without any tools.

Fylgja is also offering its CSS components in many flavors,
so if you use PostCSS instead of SCSS,
you can still use Fylgja just with the SCSS version.
Making it not bound to a spefic pre/post processor.
